# karpathy_NNzero2hero
These are my follow-along solutions and implementations to Andrej Karpathy's "[Neural Network: Zero to Hero Course](https://karpathy.ai/zero-to-hero.html)", a series of short lectures following the development of a language model in multiple stages (bigram, MLP, wave net, transformer).

Despite already having some experience with many of the topics covered throughout Andrej Karpathy's lectures, I wanted to reinforce the fundamental concepts and skills necessary in machine learning, while also getting a new perspective on the topics. For anyone who is also new to the field, I highly recommend following the same lectures as they are extremely informative and helpful.
